# Rela_cRel_Model
Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) model of NFkB signaling network in macrophages with stimulus responses of Rela and cRel

Analysis and Visualizations for Math Modeling results presented in "Co-Imaging of RelA and c-Rel Reveals Features of NF-kappaB Signaling for Ligand Discrimination" (Rahman et al., 2023)

Model_Script: Contains NFkB Math Model Code (adapted from Adelaja et al. 2021)

Baseline_Simulations: Contains baseline simulations of Rela and cRel in response to 7 stimuli and comparison between experimental and model trajectories (RMSD, features)

Parameter_Variation: Vary binding affinity of IkB's and NFkB's as well as IKK and IkB's.  Must unzip files in simulation_results subdirectory and run generate_simulation_results_files.m prior to executing analysis in main directory.

Alpha_Mut_Epsilon_KO: Contains mutant simulations of Rela and cRel in response to TNF and LPS.
